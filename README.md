# banking-customer-retention
From unsuccesful ANOVA to classification model predicting customer's behaviour. In this project I make an attempt to build a model that takes into an account a varity of different features such as balance, income, products in use, as well as geographical location to predict if the customer is going to leave the bank. 
The dataset came from the Kaggle website, and here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling . Don't forget to check the work in jupyter notebook!
